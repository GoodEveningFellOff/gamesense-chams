Welcome to my custom chams lua for gamesense.pub that I made without even having the cheat. I still dont have it but ill make sure to keep the lua updated and working properly.

Yes this script is *potentially detected and it is advised to not use this lua without having the game in -untrusted mode. If you get banned in game because of this lua I am not responsible. Dont cheat on accounts you care about.

Common Issues:
  P: "The chams are all not rendering / rendering invisibly even when its not selected to be inivisible... is the lua broken???"
  S: No the lua isnt broken, make sure you have installed the materials correctly and if you have press the reload materials button at the bottom of the script to reload textures.
 
  P: "I got an untrusted ban / my trust factor was greatly impacted because of your lua!!!"
  A: As I have stated this lua is untrusted so dont use the lua on an account you care about
