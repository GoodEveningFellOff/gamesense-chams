Welcome to my custom chams lua for gamesense.pub that I made without even having the cheat. I still dont have it but ill make sure to keep the lua updated and working properly.

Yes this script is *potentially detected and it is advised to not use this lua without having the game in -untrusted mode. If you get banned in game because of this lua I am not responsible. Dont cheat on accounts you care about.

Common Issues:
  P: "The material is black even though I have it set to a different color"
  A: Reloading the script should fix the problem, I am working on a proper fix soon
  
  P: "Some features in the lua arnt woking properly like reflectivity color isnt working!"
  A: Updates can sometimes require you uninstall your current materials and install the new ones. 
  
  P: "I got an untrusted ban / my trust factor was greatly impacted because of your lua!!!"
  A: As I have stated this lua is untrusted so dont use the lua on an account you care about
